# ParticleSimulator


Please use the provided .bat files to generate the project. The PhysicsLib library should be generated first. The ParticlaSimulator folder contains the main program, and the PaticleSimulator_Tests folder contains the tests for the PhysicsLib library.

"Particle Simulator" is the project I developed for my Object-Oriented Languages class at AGH UST. It serves as an exercise in accurate analysis, design, and implementation of a computer program using an Object-Oriented Language, specifically C++20.

This program is designed to operate on Microsoft Windows x86/x64 systems with a C++20 compiler. For compatibility with other operating systems, the SDL library must be recompiled. Note that the CMake process may not function correctly on alternative operating systems, but this can be addressed by modifying the CMakeLists files.

I apologize for any shortcomings in the project's sophistication, as it primarily served as a means to grasp the fundamentals of program structure and the process of creating and maintaining a project.
