# ParticleSimulator

Please use the provided .bat files to generate the project.

Particle Simulator is the project I made for my Object Oriented Languages class at AGH UST. It is an exercise in correct analysis, design and writing of a computer program using an Object Oriented Language, in this case C++20. 
This program is designed to work with Microsoft Windows x86/x64 and a C++20 compiler. For compatibility with other OS the SDL library must be compiled again.
Please forgive me for the crudity of the project, as it was mostly a way to learn the basics of program structure and how to generate and maintain a project.
